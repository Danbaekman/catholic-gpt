## How to Contribute

### Issues

- Check the **Issues** tab for open tasks or bugs

## Code Guidelines

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with Shadcn components where applicable)
- **Linting & Formatting**: Please see the `README` for more on this
- **Component Structure**: Prefer small, composable components.

## Branching and Pull Requests

- Branch off `main`.
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-chat-bubbles`, `fix/mobile-navbar`).
- Open a **Draft Pull Request** early if you’d like feedback before finalizing.
- All PRs should:
  - Reference the related issue (if applicable).
  - Include a clear description of the change.
  - Include screenshots if the change is visual.
